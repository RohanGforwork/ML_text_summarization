# Twitter Sentiment & Summary with Translation, Slang Detection, and Inference

This project allows users to input tweets, which are processed through multiple steps in the backend to provide translated, slang-checked, and summarized text. It also includes sentiment analysis (inference) based on the tweet content. The flow includes user input, translation via Google Translate, slang detection, and text summarization, followed by optional sentiment analysis for better understanding.

## Features

- **Frontend:**
  - Accepts input from users in the form of Twitter tweets.
  
- **Backend:**
  - **Translation:** Detects the input language and translates the tweet to English using Google Translate.
  - **Slang Detection:** Detects and filters out profanity and slang words using custom filters and external libraries.
  - **Summarization:** Translated text is processed for summarization (simplifying the text).
  - **Sentiment Analysis:** Provides an inference on the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) of the tweet using a transformer-based model.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or any JS framework like React or Angular)
  
- **Backend:**
  - Python (Flask/Django)
  - Google Translate API
  - **Libraries:**
    - `better_profanity` for profanity detection
    - `wordfilter` for advanced slang filtering
    - `nltk` for wordnet (slang detection)
    - **Transformer Models** for sentiment analysis (RoBERTa)

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you will need to set up the following:

### Frontend

- A web server that can serve the frontend (e.g., using `npm` or `webpack`).

### Backend

- Python 3.7 or later.
- Required libraries:
  - Flask or Django
  - googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 (for Google Translate API)
  - better_profanity
  - wordfilter
  - nltk (for wordnet and slang detection)
  - transformers (for sentiment analysis using pre-trained models)

```bash
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 better_profanity nltk wordfilter transformers torch
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML_text_summarization.git
   cd twitter-sentiment-summary
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up and run the backend server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open the frontend (in your browser) to interact with the app.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser (once the backend and frontend are running).
2. Enter a tweet into the input field.
3. After submitting, the backend will:
   - Detect the language of the tweet and translate it to English if needed.
   - Detect and flag any slang or profanity in the text.
   - Summarize the translated text to give a more concise version.
4. After receiving the summary, the user can optionally request a sentiment analysis to get the inferred sentiment of the tweet (positive, neutral, or negative).

### Example Flow:

1. **User Input:**
   - *"madarchod kya kar raha hai"*

2. **Backend Processing:**
   - **Translation:** "What is Madarchod doing"
   - **Slang Detection:** Flags the word "Madarchod" as profanity.
   - **Summarization:** "What is Madarchod doing"
   
3. **User Request:**
   - **Sentiment Inference:** "Sentiment: Negative (Confidence: 0.85)"

## Example Code:

The following sections highlight the key modules in the backend:

### 1. **Language Translation & Slang Detection**

```python
from googletrans import Translator
from better_profanity import profanity
from wordfilter import Wordfilter
import nltk

nltk.download('wordnet')
word_filter = Wordfilter()

CUSTOM_PROFANITY = ["chutiya", "bhosdike", "gaandu", "madarchod", "behnchod"]
profanity.add_censor_words(CUSTOM_PROFANITY)

class LanguageTranslator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.translator = Translator()

    def is_slang_or_profanity(self, text):
        ...
        
    def detect_and_translate(self, text):
        ...
```

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis (Inference)**

```python
from transformers import RobertaTokenizer, RobertaForSequenceClassification
from scipy.special import softmax

class ElectionSentimentAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, model_name="cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment"):
        ...
        
    def analyze_tweet_sentiment(self, text):
        ...
```
